# Keg Toys

In order to tidy up some of the aspects around keg usage and dispense, I've thrown together a OpenSCAD file to generate a set of tools.

## Why?

Because problems can be fixed and no-one wants sticky beer residue all over their countertops or kegerator :man_shrugging:

## Heads-Up

> [!WARNING]
> You're welcome to use & abuse these materials as you wish, but you do so at your own risk.  
> I am *not* an expert in 3D printing nor structural analysis, far from it.
>
> There are many improvements which could be made, these designs were made quickly to improve an annoyance, they've not been through a rigorous requirements capture phase...

## Current Tools

The below are the current tools which can be generated using the script.

> [!TIP]
> The script currently has no guard-rails, you can generate broken geometries - Make sure the model passes the sniff test before actually printing anything.

### Drip Catcher

The drip tray sprang out of a Dungeons and Dragons BBQ -> The party tap was leaving a few drips on the counter each time someone poured a beer - No bueno!

Hooks on to the side of your keg to catch drips, that's it!

See [Drip Catcher](/DripCatcher).

### CO2 Holder
